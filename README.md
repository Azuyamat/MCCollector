## Details

MCCollector is a library which replicates the functionality [Discord.js message collectors](https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/collectors.html#basic-message-collector) into Minecraft. It allows you to collect messages from players in a similar way to how you would with Discord.js.
Collectors are useful for creating secure and efficient prompts. They allow you to inquire information from players in a controlled manner.

Some examples of what you can do with collectors:
- Prompt player for username that respects a certain format
- Prompt certainty with a yes/no question before proceeding (I.e "Are you sure you want to delete this?")
- Prompt player for a number within a certain range
- Ask moderator for a reason before banning a player

> Let me know if you have any other ideas for collectors! :smile:

## Usage

> [!WARNING]
> If you are placing blocks in any of the callbacks, make sure to run them on the main thread.
> You can use `Bukkit.getScheduler().runTask(plugin, runnable)` to run code on the main thread.
> This limitation is not one of MCCollector, but rather Bukkit's API.

### Initialization

```kotlin
class MyPlugin : JavaPlugin() {
    override fun onEnable() {
        CollectorRegistry.init(this)
    }
}
```

### Basic Example

> [!NOTE]
> `onCommand` is used as an example, you would have you own method to handle commands.
```kotlin
fun onCommand(...) {
    val collector = ChatCollectorBuilder {
        player.sendMessage("Type 'hello' to continue.")
    }.applyPrefab(MessagesPrefab(player)) // Apply default messages (Ex: "Invalid input" in red)
    .buildAndRegister(player) // Build and register the collector to the player
}
```

### Advanced Example

```kotlin
fun onCommand(...) {
    val collector = ChatCollectorBuilder {
        player.sendMessage("Provide a name for your island.")
    }.withTimeout(10000)
        .onCollect {
            player.sendMessage("Creating island: $it")
        }
        .onCancel {
            player.sendMessage("Island creation cancelled.")
        }
        .onTimeout {
            player.sendMessage("Island creation timed out.")
        }
        .verifyValue {
            if (it.length > 3) {
                Verifiable.ValidationResult.valid()
            } else {
                Verifiable.ValidationResult.invalid("Island name must be longer than 3 characters.")
            }
        }
        .build(player).register() // Or use .buildAndRegister(player)
}
```
