# MCCollector

## Details

MCCollector is a library which replicates the functionality [Discord.js message collectors](https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/collectors.html#basic-message-collector) into Minecraft. It allows you to collect messages from players in a similar way to how you would with Discord.js.
Collectors are useful for creating secure and efficient prompts. They allow you to inquire information from players in a controlled manner.

Some examples of what you can do with collectors:
- Prompt player for username that respects a certain format
- Prompt certainty with a yes/no question before proceeding (I.e "Are you sure you want to delete this?")
- Prompt player for a number within a certain range
- Ask moderator for a reason before banning a player
